# ModelEmbedderDistillation [[RUS](https://github.com/FractalGPT/ModelEmbedderDistilation/blob/main/README_RUS.md)]

## About the Project
`ModelEmbedderDistillation` is a project focused on distilling complex embedding models (such as Sbert, E5) to simplify and enhance their efficiency for use in various machine learning applications.

## Features

- **Sbert Distillation**: The process of simplifying the Sbert model to optimize performance without significant loss of accuracy.
- **Sbert Distillation with Layer Decomposition**: An advanced distillation method that includes the decomposition of model layers for deeper optimization.
- **C# Version Based on AI Framework**: Implementation of the aforementioned distillation methods in C#, using the AI Framework for easy integration into .NET projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with `ModelEmbedderDistillation`, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the installation section.
